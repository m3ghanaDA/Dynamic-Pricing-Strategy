# Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy
Dynamic Pricing is an application of Data Science that involves adjusting product or service prices based on various factors in real time. It is employed by businesses to optimize their revenue and profitability by setting flexible prices that respond to market demand, customer behaviour, and competitor pricing.

Using data-driven insights and algorithms, businesses can dynamically modify prices to achieve the most favourable outcomes.

For example, consider a ride-sharing company operating in a metropolitan area. The company wants to optimize its pricing strategy to maximize revenue and improve customer satisfaction. The traditional pricing model used by the business is based on fixed rates per kilometre, which does not account for fluctuations in supply and demand.

By implementing a dynamic pricing strategy, the company can leverage data science techniques to analyze various factors such as historical trip data, real-time demand, traffic patterns, and events happening in the area.

Using Machine Learning algorithms, the company can analyze data and adjust its prices in real-time. When demand is high, such as during rush hours or major events, the algorithm can increase the cost of the rides to incentivize more drivers to be available and balance the supply and demand. Conversely, during periods of low demand, the algorithm can lower the prices to attract more customers.

## Overview

- Implemented Dynamic Pricing Strategy: Developed and executed a dynamic pricing model using Python, optimizing
revenue by adjusting ride costs based on real-time demand and supply data.

- Data-Driven Decision Making: Leveraged historical sales data, customer behavior insights, and market trends to drive
pricing adjustments, increasing profitability in high-demand periods.

- Advanced Data Analysis: Utilized machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools like Plotly to analyze ride
duration, cost, and customer segmentation, enhancing pricing accuracy and customer satisfaction.

- Predictive Modeling: Trained and deployed a machine learning model to predict ride costs, incorporating factors such as
the number of drivers, riders, and vehicle type, resulting in a 82.7% increase in profitable rides.
